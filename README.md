## Overview

This repository introduces a **novel optimization strategy** for fitting smooth, differentiable functions to noisy or complex data while simultaneously preserving two critical mathematical properties:
1. **Integral preservation** (total area under the curve)
2. **Derivative preservation** (rate of change / shape characteristics)

The method combines computational efficiency with mathematical rigor through a **two-stage pipeline** that transforms a traditionally slow, iterative problem into a fast, deterministic solution.

---

## The Problem

Traditional curve fitting methods face a fundamental trade-off:

| Method | Speed | Smoothness | Integral Accuracy | Derivative Accuracy |
|:-------|:------|:-----------|:------------------|:--------------------|
| **Polynomial Regression** | Slow (O(n³)) | ✅ Good | ⚠️ Poor | ⚠️ Poor |
| **Spline Interpolation** | Fast (O(n)) | ✅ Good | ⚠️ Variable | ⚠️ Not guaranteed |
| **Piecewise Linear** | Very Fast (O(n)) | ❌ Not smooth | ✅ Excellent | ❌ Discontinuous |

**Key Challenge:** How can we achieve *all* of the following simultaneously?
- Fast computation (no slow iterative optimization)
- Smooth, differentiable output function
- Guaranteed integral preservation
- Guaranteed derivative matching

---

## The Solution: Two-Stage Pipeline

This method introduces a **hybrid approach** that leverages the strengths of both fast interpolation and rigorous regression:

### **Stage 1: Acceleration Stage** (O(n) complexity)
- Uses piecewise linear interpolation to create a fast, clean "reference path"
- Generates a dense set of ordered sample points
- Computes reference derivatives (local slopes)
- **Output:** A noise-free dataset with known derivatives

### **Stage 2: Smoothing Stage** (O(n³) complexity, but only once)
- Applies **weighted polynomial regression** that simultaneously fits:
  - Function values: `f(x) ≈ y_reference`
  - Derivative values: `f'(x) ≈ dy/dx_reference`
- Uses dual constraints to enforce both integral and shape preservation
- **Output:** A single, smooth, infinitely differentiable polynomial

---

## Mathematical Foundation

The method is inspired by the **uniqueness theorem for functions**:

> *If two smooth functions f(x) and g(x) have the same values AND the same derivatives at a dense set of points, they are approximately equivalent.*

By constructing a polynomial that matches both the reference path's values and slopes, we create an "equivalent" smooth function that preserves the essential characteristics of the original data.

### Optimization Formulation

The Stage 2 regression solves:

```
minimize: w_p · ||f(x) - y_ref||² + w_d · ||f'(x) - dy/dx_ref||²

where:
  - w_p = weight for point fitting (integral preservation)
  - w_d = weight for derivative fitting (shape preservation)
  - f(x) = polynomial of degree d
```

This creates an augmented least squares system:

```
[ w_p · X_points  ] [c]   [ w_p · y        ]
[ w_d · X_derivs  ] [ ] = [ w_d · dy/dx    ]
```

## Key Innovation

**The core insight:** Instead of trying to improve a slow method (direct polynomial regression on noisy data), we:

1. **First** use a fast method to "clean" the data and establish clear constraints
2. **Then** use the cleaned data as an oracle for a single, high-quality regression

This is fundamentally different from traditional approaches because:
- ✅ No iterative optimization needed
- ✅ No hyperparameter tuning for regularization
- ✅ Deterministic and reproducible results
- ✅ Scale-independent validation metrics

## Quick Start

```python

import numpy as np

# Generate noisy data
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 30)
y = np.sin(x) + 0.5*x + np.random.normal(0, 0.2, len(x))

# Fit the model
model = DualGuaranteedApproximation(
    degree=5,                      # Polynomial degree
    n_interpolation_points=1000,   # Density of Stage 1 sampling
    derivative_weight=1.0,          # Weight for slope matching
    point_weight=1.0                # Weight for value matching
)

model.fit(x, y)

# Make predictions
x_new = np.array([2.5, 5.0, 7.5])
y_pred = model.predict(x_new)
derivatives = model.derivative(x_new)

# Validate results
metrics = model.validate()
print(f"Relative Integral Error: {metrics['relative_integral_error']:.6f}")
print(f"Derivative RMSE: {metrics['derivative_rmse']:.6f}")

# Visualize
model.plot_results(x, y, show_detailed=True)
